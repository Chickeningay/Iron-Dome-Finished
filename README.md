# Iron Dome Finished
 
inspired by the real life anti air defence system iron dome

missile detection-tracking-interception simulation

no information about the missiles are given except what a real life radar could learn (wave bounce back time and angle), which we use to find the position of the missile

afterwards we combine detection data from multiple radars since real life radars have really short ranges, then we put them into objects and match every missile object to the closest radar bounce to keep active track

lastly, we calculate an interception chase problem to find the position where our interceptors should aim, which turn to chasing mode once close enough and intercept

i added some features to be able to play around with it

maybe this will get me a military industrial complex programming internship üòÅ

also yeah obviously i used ai for some mundane tasks but most of the code is written by me
